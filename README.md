# Warmer Than Yesterday


Most weather apps only show the temperature for today, and often neglect showing yesterday's temperature. So, if you wore shorts yesterday, but you forgot yesterday's weather, then it is hard to figure out whether you can wear them again today! And that is not all. The temperature that is shown by most weather apps is not representative to how warm it actually feels. So, even if the temperature stays the same, you might feel a lot colder today than yesterday because the wind has picked up! In other words, you might unexpectedly be chilly in those shorts, even though the temperature stayed the same!

This is where the "feels-like" temperature comes in, also known as the "wind chill equivalent temperature". It is based on the actual temperature and the wind speed. This app, Warmer Than Yesterday, compares today's "feels-like" temperature to yesterday's "feels-like" temperature for your location.

Warmer Than Yesterday has the following features:
- Shows the "feels-like" temperature change since yesterday
- Choose between an imperial or metric temperature scale
- Adapts to your phone's light/dark display setting
